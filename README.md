# detached_Ibc
Light curve model grid of interacting SN Ibc with detached CSM, based on a model of [Takei & Tsuna (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02566).
The columns are as shown in the first row of each file, in cgs units. The effective radius and color radius may be more questionable than the bolometric luminosity (second column), due to possible incomplete thermalization.

This is a subset of the (vast) parameter space used for publication, to get a sense of how the light curve depends on each parameter.
If you wish to fit a light curve that this scenario may work (i.e. slow rising time, double peaks...), and you can't find a light curve that matches well, please contact us and we're happy to help run additional calculations.
We will release the source code upon acceptance of the manuscript, as part of our [CHIPS project](https://github.com/DTsuna/CHIPS).
